Find the conversation history file for THIS specific Claude Code session and prepare it for transfer to a SafeClaude container with metadata for easy identification.

**Usage:**
- `/safeclaude <project-name>` - Auto-generate summary from conversation context
- `/safeclaude <project-name> <summary>` - Use user-provided summary

**Steps:**
1. Identify the current conversation file:
   - Get current working directory and find the corresponding project directory in ~/.claude/projects/
   - List all .jsonl files in that directory sorted by modification time
   - Read the last few messages from the most recent file(s)
   - Match against your conversation memory to confirm it's the right file
   - If uncertain, present options to the user for confirmation
2. Generate or use provided summary:
   - If summary provided: use it
   - If not: analyze conversation and create concise 1-2 sentence summary
3. Extract the last 2-3 user/assistant message snippets (first 80 chars each) for preview
4. Generate metadata JSON with:
   - format_version: "1.0"
   - project name
   - conversation ID
   - timestamp (epoch seconds)
   - summary (user-provided or auto-generated)
   - last message snippets for preview
   - ISO timestamp
5. Copy conversation file to: `~/.safeclaude/transfer/<project>-<timestamp>.jsonl`
6. Save metadata to: `~/.safeclaude/transfer/<project>-<timestamp>.json`
7. Set secure permissions: `chmod 600` on both files
8. Display the summary and simple instructions

**Arguments:**
- PROJECT_NAME: {PROJECT_NAME}
- SUMMARY: {SUMMARY} (optional - you'll generate one if not provided)

**Technical details:**
- Use $PWD to determine project directory path
- Convert path format: /Users/name/path â†’ -Users-name-path
- Search ~/.claude/projects/<converted-path>/ for .jsonl files
- Sort by modification time (mtime) - most recent first
- Read last 5-10 lines of top candidates with `tail` and parse with jq
- Verify messages match this conversation's context
- Use high-precision timestamp (date +%s%N on Linux, python time on macOS) for unique filenames
- Extract conversation ID from filename (UUID before .jsonl extension)

**After creating transfer files, tell the user:**
```
Conversation prepared for transfer!

To continue in SafeClaude:
